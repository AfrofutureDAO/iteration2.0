# An overview: how we organize the AfrofutureDAO Team's efforts
With [Interation2.0](https://snapshot.org/#/afrofuture.eth/proposal/QmatxrVU3Zptta9RmqtSXzHS2QHYP4Rvu2dfLZKbGMcbNL) of AfrofutureDAO, our focus is on staging the cultural and technical launch pad required to enable the transitioning of African Artists into web 3 while stewarding the assets of African Culture and history using our all-inclusive on-boarding pattern and collaborations with the museums and curators.  
 
We manage this work in Zenhub which we will continue to keep updated.
 
You can support our mission first and foremost by [donating through our treasury](0xBE918163c3839071de42F8529916DfE83e3B6897).You can also contribute time to the AfrofutureDAO mission, find out more about this by [joining our commmunity](https://hackmd.io/@CDCamKLDTGunQq4UFqByOQ/ryimo6G7j).
 
Know that with these extra funds you will not only be supporting us as a core team, but a wide network of contributors, and every contribution is transparently accounted for.
 
With these funds we will accomplish the following key goals:
 
- [ ] A Web 3 Launchpad for African creatives through Quarterly NFT Artist Commissioning / Drops 
 
- [ ] A platform for museums & cultural institutions to monetize their archives through AMF
 
- [ ] Create a robust African NFT Community that will be a resource for Onboarding and Integration of African Web 3 Techies 
 
- [ ] Research and communicate on our initialization tools and planned components
 
- [ ] Continue to grow the AFTR Whitelist, and be an anchor for the African Creatives movement
